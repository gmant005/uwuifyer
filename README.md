# uwuifyer
A short C program to UWUify a string of text.

|How To Use|

(this was made in and for linux so right now I dont have any instructions for windows.)
It will take whatever you pipe into it and give you the uwued output.

Example:
echo "this would be the text you want to be uwued." | ./uwu
and the output will be something like this
this wouwuwd be t-the text youwu want to be uwuwued.
