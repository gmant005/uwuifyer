A short C program to UWUify a string of text.

|How To Use|

(the windows instructions may not be the best because im not too familer with the CMD)

Linux
It will take whatever you pipe into it and give you the uwued output.

Example:
echo "this would be the text you want to be uwued." | ./uwu
and the output will be something like this
this wouwuwd be t-the text youwu want to be uwuwued.
